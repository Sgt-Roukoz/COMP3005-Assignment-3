What is this?:
This is a submission for COMP3005 Assignment 3 - Part 1

This project serves to demonstrate Java's Database Driver for postgreSQL, and how you would connect to a known database through
Java code.

Installation:
Download the repository from GitHub as a ZIP
Extract COMP3005-Assignment3-master.zip
Open IntelliJ
Click Open and select COMP3005-Assignment3-master project folder inside the extracted folder

To Use This:
First you must create a database with PostgreSQL, to do this, run pgAdmin4 and login. Keep note of your username and password.
Under Servers, right-click Databases and Create>Database... Name this database Students and click save. Now the database has been created
Next we need to put some data. To do this, right-click the database you just created and select Query Tool. Now select the folder Icon (Open File)
and select the DDL file, which you will find in the project under src/Database Scripts. Now run it by pressing F5 or the arrow in pgAdmin4.
This should have created a named students, which you can see under Schemas>Tables in your database. Next we need to populate this table, so you
must open the DML file this time, and run it, which will populate the table with some values.

Before running this application, navigate to the DatabaseInteraction file which is under src/main/java/org.assignment3_3005 (You can navigate through
it on the left side of the IDE). Using the username and password you took note of, change the variables String user and String password to your
username and password respectively. Next, to run this application navigate to the Main java class file, which should be in the same directory
and then either click the Green arrow button next to the main method of the Main class or pressing Shift+F10. This will
run the functions currently written in the main method (which at the moment is simply getting all students).
